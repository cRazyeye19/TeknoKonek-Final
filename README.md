## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run TeknoKonek on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (Node Package Manager, usually comes with Node.js)
- MongoDB (Community Server or access to a MongoDB Atlas cluster)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TeknoKonek.git
cd TeknoKonek
```

### 2. Backend Setup (Server)

Navigate to the `server` directory, install dependencies, and configure environment variables.

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following. **Do not commit this file to version control.**

```
MONGO_DB="<your_mongo_db_connection_string>" # MongoDB connection URI (e.g., from MongoDB Atlas or local instance)
PORT="<your_port>" # Port for the backend server to listen on (e.g., 5000)
JWT_KEY="<your_jwt_key>" # A strong, random string for JWT authentication
EMAIL_HOST="<your_email_host>" # Host for the email service (e.g., smtp.gmail.com)
EMAIL_PORT="<your_email_port>" # Port for the email service (e.g., 587 for TLS)
EMAIL_USER="<your_email_user>" # Username for the email service
EMAIL_PASS="<your_email_pass>" # Password for the email service
EMAIL_FROM="<your_email_from>" # Email address to send from
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your_cloudinary_cloud_name>
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your_cloudinary_api_key>
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<your_cloudinary_api_secret>
```

Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your MongoDB URI (e.g., from MongoDB Atlas or your local instance).
You can choose any port, e.g., `5000`.
`your_jwt_secret_key` should be a strong, random string.

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will run on the specified PORT (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).

### 3. Real-time Communication Setup (Socket)

Open a new terminal, navigate to the `socket` directory, install dependencies, and configure environment variables.

```bash
cd ../socket
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `socket` directory and add the following. **Do not commit this file to version control.**

```
CORS_ORIGIN="<your_CORS_origin_here>" # The origin URL of your client application (e.g., http://localhost:3000)
PORT="<your_port_here>" # Port for the Socket.io server to listen on (e.g., 8800)
```

This should match the origin of your client application.

Start the socket server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The socket server will run on port `8800`.

### 4. Frontend Setup (Client)

Open another new terminal, navigate to the `client` directory, install dependencies, and configure environment variables.

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory and add the following. **Do not commit this file to version control.**

```
REACT_APP_API_URL="<your_api_url>" # URL of the backend API server (e.g., http://localhost:5000)
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL="<your_socket_url>" # URL of the Socket.io server (e.g., http://localhost:8800)
```

Ensure `REACT_APP_BASE_URL` matches your backend server's address and `REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL` matches your socket server's address.

Start the frontend application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The client application will typically run on `http://localhost:3000`.
