## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run TeknoKonek on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
-   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
-   npm (Node Package Manager, usually comes with Node.js)
-   MongoDB (Community Server or access to a MongoDB Atlas cluster)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TeknoKonek.git
cd TeknoKonek
```

### 2. Backend Setup (Server)

Navigate to the `server` directory, install dependencies, and configure environment variables.

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following:

```
MONGO_DB="your_mongodb_connection_string"
PORT=5000
JWT_KEY="your_jwt_secret_key"
```
Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your MongoDB URI (e.g., from MongoDB Atlas or your local instance).
You can choose any port, e.g., `5000`.
`your_jwt_secret_key` should be a strong, random string.

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will run on the specified PORT (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).

### 3. Real-time Communication Setup (Socket)

Open a new terminal, navigate to the `socket` directory, install dependencies, and configure environment variables.

```bash
cd ../socket
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `socket` directory and add the following:

```
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
```
This should match the origin of your client application.

Start the socket server:

```bash
npm start
```

The socket server will run on port `8800`.

### 4. Frontend Setup (Client)

Open another new terminal, navigate to the `client` directory, install dependencies, and configure environment variables.

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory and add the following:

```
REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:8800
```
Ensure `REACT_APP_BASE_URL` matches your backend server's address and `REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL` matches your socket server's address.

Start the frontend application:

```bash
npm start
```

The client application will typically run on `http://localhost:3000`.
